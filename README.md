**Anonymously Access ChatGPT, Claude, Meta, and More for FREE**

I promise it works and take literally 1 minute to sign-up. Glad to help any other student if you are like me and can't afford a ChatGPT subscription.

I just stumbled upon a **game-changing** service: **Hoody AI**. It's a dashboard that lets you access multiple AI models **anonymously**, including:

* OpenAI's GPT-4o mini
* GPT 3.5
* Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet 
* Claude 3 Haiku
* Meta's Llama 3.1 405B/70B
* ... (I believe they have more models)

**Get Started**

Create an account here: [https://hoody.com/create-account](https://hoody.com/create-account)

**Pro Tip**: When you reach limits, simply use another VPN, re-create a new account in a private window, and enjoy **unlimited limits** :D

For context, Hoody AI is a new product from Hoody.com, a relatively recent **privacy company**. They recently made a huge breakthrough and ended up top product of the month on Producthunt and Theresanaiforthat.
I'm not posting this to encourage abuse of their services, please consider subscribing if you like it. 

If this was useful, consider donating, even a tiny bit would really, REALLY help me.
